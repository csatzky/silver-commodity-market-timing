# Silver Commodity Market Timingâ€“A Simple Macroeconomic Model

In this article, I present a theoretical pricing model based on macroecnomic information. Secondly, I am empirically investigating key properties of this model by using recent market data. From these findings, I finally construct a statistical fair-value indicator for the silver spot price. This indicator conveniently absorbs statistically significant macroeconomic information that is impacting silver spot pricing.

This research is 100% reproducible.
